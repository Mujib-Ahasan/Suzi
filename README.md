#  Suzi Load Tester
Suzi is a lightweight, flexible, and extensible HTTP load testing tool written in Go.
Itâ€™s designed for developers and DevOps engineers who want quick insights into application performance without relying on heavy external tools.

## Features
- ### Multiple Attack Types:
     - Basic Load â€“ send a fixed number of requests at a constant rate.
     - Burst Load â€“ hammer the server with a sudden spike of requests.
     - Ramp-Up Load â€“ gradually increase request rate from low to peak.
     - Random Load - send requests in a random manner.
- ### Latency Percentiles (p50, p90, p95, p99):
  get detailed insights into response time distribution. Useful when need to get over all idea about user experience.
- ### Result Visualization:
     - Generates an interactive HTML report with charts (response time per request).
     - Includes a latency summary table showing percentile breakdown.
- ### Configurable Timeout per request:
  simulate slow responses or protect against server hangs. One of the important feature in day-to-day server testing (basic).
- ### Extensible Design:
  future-ready to add features like email notifications after testing or CI/CD integration.

## Installation
- #### Clone the repo first:
       git clone https://github.com/Mujib-Ahasan/Suzi.git
       cd suzi
- #### Build the binary:
      go build -o suzi.exe  -> for windows
      go build -o suzi -> for Linux/macOS
- #### Run the examples below:
       -------Disable the timeout and plot function just by removing the flags---------
       //Basic attack
      ./suzi -url https://example.com -req 50 -rate 5 -atk basic -timeout 5 -plot true

       //Burst attack
      ./suzi -url https://example.com -req 50 -atk burst -timeout 5 -plot true

       //Ramp-Up attack
      ./suzi -url https://example.com -req 50  -atk rampup -timeout 5 -plot true

       // Random attack
      ./suzi -url https://example.com -req 50 -rate 5 -attack basic -timeout 5 -plot true

## Now The Most Fun One - Why Suzi? ðŸ¤”
- Most load testers (like JMeter or Locust) are heavy, complex, and overkill for quick checks.
- Our Suzi Offers:
     - Simple â€“ one binary, easy flags, no config files.
     - Fast â€“ written in Go with goroutines for concurrency.
     - Extensible â€“ easy to add attack strategies and plotting.
     - Developer-Friendly â€“ quick experiments, local testing, and custom benchmark.
